# ocTOMaTRIX
ocTOMaTRIX max patch/complex object, model for possible modular synth module

main object is octomatrix, all others are sub-patches.  Make sure all can be seen by Max.  Octomatrix itself is intended for use in a bpatcher, so it should be in search path also for example

be gentle as this is a work in progress

routes 8 audio inputs to 8 audio outputs via a mixer matrix controlled by a monome 128 grid

also applies one of 8 audio effects to each audio input, selectable via monome 128 grid and controlable via a monome arc4, with one cv input per audio input for further modulation.
